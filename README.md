Using this managed to get just over $100 worth of gift cards + 2 headsets and a router lol.

In Late 2020 somehow I had the time and energy to do this. Too much time as an undergrad.
A lot of steps were still manual but it was automated to a decent extent.
Using Pytesseract and cv2, the program would just read some text, and then move the cursor to certain locations to do random clicking for 5 minutes.
Then if I won the bihourly lottery, the program collects the gift cards.

The headsets and routers were extra bonuses I did not expect lol. I still use the router. It's pretty good. Headsets were average.
